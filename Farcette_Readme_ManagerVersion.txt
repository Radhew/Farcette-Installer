All cutscenes edited by DaThings

This mod is in no way affiliated with Seedy Eye Software or Limited Run Games. By using this modification you accept all risks associated with tampering with your game files.

Farcette is written in English and only designed to work with the PC version of the game. It is and always will be free. If you have been charged money for this mod, you have been scammed.

Note about Keying:
Because of the way in-game videos are displayed using chroma key, you will often see little blue artifacts around the edge pixels during cutscenes. This is a known issue and can not be "fixed" without making other parts of the video look worse.
